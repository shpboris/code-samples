1.
Start mongodb-sleuth application and current application (feign-client-sleuth)

2.
Use this to invoke the feign-client-sleuth API - http://localhost:7000/users/swagger-ui.html

3.
Pay attention to configuration of my-trace-id header in application.yaml - it allows
to make sleuth to pass custom header along the whole request chain ! The header is
still not printed to log though, not sure why ....
